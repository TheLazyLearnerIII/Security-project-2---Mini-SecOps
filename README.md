# SECURITY PROJECT - MINI SECOPS

- An end-to-end **cloud security mini project** using Terraform, Docker, ScoutSuite, & GitHub Actions

## Overview

- This project provisions a secure AWS environment with **Terraform**, runs a **ScoutSuite** audit inside a Docker container, and automates scans using **GitHub Actions**.  

This projects demonstrates:
        - IaC for AWS security (S3 log bucket, CloudTrail, GuardDuty)
        - Security auditing with ScoutSuite
        - CI/CD automation to generate audit reports on every push

## Tech Stack

- **Terraform** â€” Infrastructure as Code  
- **AWS** â€” CloudTrail, GuardDuty, S3  
- **Docker** â€” Containerized ScoutSuite  
- **ScoutSuite** â€” Multi-cloud security auditing tool  
- **GitHub Actions** â€” CI/CD automation for cloud scans

## Key Findings & Remediation

ScoutSuite identified a **Danger-level issue**:  
- **CloudTrail misconfiguration** (not fully secured/logging as expected).

**Remediation (via Terraform):**  
- Fixed S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail logs.  
- Ensured versioning + encryption enabled on log bucket.  
- Verified CloudTrail is writing logs to the bucket.  

* Re-scanned with ScoutSuite to confirm improvements.
